# The problem solves

- ♻️ Our inspiration for creating Fatafat Finance came from the recognition that managing finances can be daunting, and that many individuals may find it challenging to make informed decisions in this area. We have personally faced similar struggles and have learned from our own experiences. In our journey, we have sought guidance from mentors and learned the best practices through trial and error.

- 🟢 We realized that creating a virtual financial platform that simulates real-world financial decisions and rewards users with virtual money, while also being gamified and fun, could be an effective way to teach financial literacy. By providing a safe and engaging space to practice decision-making and money management, we hope to help users build financial confidence and gain a better understanding of the financial system.

- 🟢 Players will be immersed in the game, assuming the role of a character who receives tasks assigned by non-playable characters (NPCs). Completing these tasks will earn players money, which can be used to purchase items from the in-game store. Additionally, players with good credit scores will have the option of taking out loans from the bank to purchase a home.
